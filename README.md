# UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp - Module 2 Challenge
## Patrick McClelland - Portfolio Website
For our module 2 Challenge this week, we were tasked to create a portfolio website that can be used to showcase our work
and be able to present it to potential future employers. Starting from scratch, I had to first conceptualized how I wanted 
my final website to look like, then I shifted over to writing my code. I started by writing my HTML document, adding my 
desired content to my webpage. Using semantic HTML tags, I organized my source code to ensure its readability. Within the 
assets folder is the corresponding CSS stylesheet for my webpage. CSS allowed me to customize the visual composition and 
layout of my HTML elements. I demonstrated my understanding of design strategies, including how to use flexbox, dynamic 
resizing a webpage when viewed on different screen sizes, as well as the integration of functioning links and images.

## User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
